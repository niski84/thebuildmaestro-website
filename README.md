The code for the website [thebuildmaestro.com](http://thebuildmaestro.com)

It mainly uses [Python](https://www.python.org), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). The site was designed to be content focused, with the main idea being that the app would read a list of directories, each having a Markdown file (called README.md, to allow me to [access my docs](static/content/articles) nicely even if my site is offline), along with any related images or files that would be linked in the document. It's also designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly.
